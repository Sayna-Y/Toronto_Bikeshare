# Toronto_Bikeshare
This is the final project for a Master of Engineering Degree at University of Toronto
In 2011, Toronto embarked on an ambitious project to enhance its urban mobility and foster a greener, more accessible cityscape. This vision gave birth to Bike Share Toronto, a system designed not just as an alternative to congested commutes but as a key part in the city's broader environmental and transportation strategy. By offering a network of easily accessible bikes, Toronto aimed to reduce car usage, lower carbon emissions, and promote healthier living. Today, this service is more than just a convenience; it's a vital part of Torontoâ€™s commitment to sustainable urban development, demonstrating the city's dedication to a healthier, more dynamic urban environment. 
As of 2024, the accessibility of Bike Share Toronto has reached new heights, with over 800 stations around town. In a significant move to bolster this initiative, Toronto has expanded its e-bike program, transitioning from a pilot to a permanent fixture within the city's transit options. By the end of 2022, the e-bike fleet had expanded from 300 to 525, supported by 15 new e-stations. This growth is set to continue, with plans to increase the fleet to 2,000 e-bikes and add 100 more e-stations by 2025.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the bike share dataset, and to understand the impact of various factors on bike-share demand and usage in Toronto. This project is divided into two parts. The first part, covered in this article, focuses on analyzing ridership patterns to identify key factors driving bike-share demand in Toronto. The second part will explore station-level analysis, comparing charging and regular stations, and how they align with TTC stations.
